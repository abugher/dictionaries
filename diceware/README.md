Directory names indicate the number and type of dice used in the generation
process.  4d6 is recommended.

4d6 contains lists with entries prefixed with a string of four digits in the
range one through six.  Roll 4d6 (four dice with six sides each) to generate
such a string at random, then look it up in the list to extract the
corresponding word.  Repeat until you have enough random words.  The list
should contain only 1296 entries (6 to the 4th), allowing a human to curate a
custom list, to increase memorability.

5d6 is almost the same, but with an extra digit in the lookup.  The list is six
times as long.  A human would have a big job to curate it, with potential
difficulty finding that many comfortable (easy to type, easy to spell) words,
and further difficulty finding that many words while avoiding similar words.
